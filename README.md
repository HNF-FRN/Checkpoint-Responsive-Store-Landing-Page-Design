A brief description of the design :

  I designed this store landing page to be clean, inviting, and easy to use on any device.
  The header gives it a fresh, modern vibe, while the product cards keep things simpleâ€”just enough detail to inform without overwhelming. 
  On mobile, everything stacks neatly, and the menu collapses into a hamburger icon to save space.
  I used Bootstrap to speed things up and ensure it looks great everywhere, from big desktops to small phones.
